 	<h2>Sprinks</h2>
		<p>Another excellent tour of exceptional good value with courses unusually close to base, which made getting near to the 40 minute rule include diversions back to England for some of our more technophobic members who eschew the SatNav.  This also afforded us more time for conviviality and stumbling upon the 99p pint at Wetherspoons. A big up for the Snorks for his organisational persistence in the face of adversity and his choices of accommodation and courses. The Rolls was just stunning.</p>
		<p>As Brother Smithy deservedly, if somewhat belatedly, adds his name to the BATWAIII, I would claim that some of us did in some small measure help him achieve this milestone. We are all aware of the need to keep the erstwhile Kebab fully lubricated for him to achieve maximum potential. Brother Bryan obviously appreciated this and, by achieving a stentorian 100+ decibels on the Rockhopper scale, forced Smithy to conclude sleep was unachievable and therefore accept the warm embrace of a bottle of Hardys Bin 53 and Sky Poker until 5am on both nights. This following a pretty good effort in the bar beforehand. Hearty congratulations to him on his win.</p>
		<p>Shanks, on the other hand, chose some bizarre reverse psychology sleight of hand by feigning complete incompetence in marking a scorecard, quoting speed was more important than accuracy. This iconoclastic heresy initially gave Diesel a 3 point advantage over Smithy, the ultimate margin of victory in the opposite direction. Now, although the electronic on course scoring innovation was not an overwhelming success through a combination of adverse weather, lack of signal and apathy, it did prove its worth as a post round scrutineer, as I am sure Shanks knew it would despite his luddite protestations. The scores were duly corrected in Smithy's favour, surely designed to spur him on and dis-hearten Diesel. The following day Diesel went on to play the best round of the tour and a disconsolate Smithy to discard. Ah well.</p>
		<p>It is worth noting that Diesel evoked stunned admiration from one of the barstaff at breakfast on Sunday. No, not her, but the ample matey boy. He commented on how one of us was quaffing some serious beverage the previous night. I thought Smithy but no he said, not Kronenbourg but Strongbow. "There's no way he'll be down anytime soon or playing golf even". I remarked that he was made of sterner stuff and sure enough Diesel strolled in with jaunty "Morning! Full works for me, please" and proceded to chat up the waitress.</p>
		<p>A final thanks to my Roomie Snorks, or should I say Xavier, not just for the organisation and ferrying me around all weekend, but for ensuring that Room 8 was victorious in Killer pool, falling on his sword numerous times in the cause. Go Room 8.</p>
	<h2>Shanks</h2>
	<p>A hearty well done to all for yet another excellent BATWAIII. The highlight has to be the performance of our new supreme champion (“It’s coming home, it’s coming home, BATWAIII’s coming home”). Perhaps others should consider a name change?
Many thanks to Snorks for his excellent organisation and cost negotiation…excellent value me thinks.
Finally I attach a scan of Sunday’s  score card for website updating Sprinks.
Winter well you loverlies.

	<h2>Snorks</h2>
	<p>Again a well earned win to Smithy, the trophy will be in good and caring  hands for the next 12 months. 
Hope that Sprinks did not have to wait too long before the AA arrived to boost his batteries.
Love the picture of Tony at the prize giving and the splendid role the Archivist is undertaking in such a timely manner.

	<h2>Diesel</h2>
	<p>What a wonderful experience, not only am I suspected to be legless on Sunday morning by the bar staff (unfortunately he was not aware of the strict training regime practised by the Breadmakers) but I am indeed legless in the prize giving photo.
I had a great time and my apologies for missing the ceremonies but sometimes the lure of money proves too great.
Congratulations to S*****Y for a magnificent win, he had 3 very good 9s and deserved his victory, my thanks to Nigel for organising the tour and of course Sprinks, Shanks and Brian for making it a memorable event as usual.
I trust you all remember signing up for the Nab Tower race next year, training will begin in January.
