    Three sets of fare were presented today. Diesel apparently is no longer allowed
    in the kitchen, and thus has no access to bread-making facilities. Sprinks presented 
    spiced ham with sloe gin infused cranberry sauce on crusty corn bread. Shanks provided a luscious
    smoked ham and Dijon mustard on brown with Snorks offering a crispy smoked bacon, lettuce
    and tomato classic. An apology was proferred by one brother for using shop bought bread, 
    due to a Panasonic breakdown.
