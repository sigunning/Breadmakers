    The Grand Draw
</p>
<p>
    Bryan with 35 Points achieves highest score of the day.
    Bryan's consistency in every department of the game on his home course ensured 
    his victory, whomsoever the gods determined should be his partner. 
    Smithy was chosen by lot in the 19th. The Handicap Committee raises one collective  eyebrow.
