    Unfortunately, Diesel called in sick with man-flu and missed a warm and calm, if a little misty, day.
    The quality of bake offerings was of the highest standards. Sprinks provided a warm bakers pasty pre round.
    Smithy a succulent chicken and stuffing in springy white. Snorks an excellent BLT with crispy bacon in crusty brown.
    And Shanks showcased a confit of duck in crusty brown infused with Nigella seeds and some cheese beginning with M.
    An excellent effort all round, but I rather think Bryan's offerings are still in his golf bag.
