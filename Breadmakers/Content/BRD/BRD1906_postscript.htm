    The Sorting Hat Decides
</p>

    Due to a catalogue of errors in marking and archival retrieval, final 
    scores have shifted numerous times. The final pairings will be drawn 
    at the next meet in August.

    A little later than planned, the pairings were drawn at the Bedford and County meet in
    Oct 2021. Diesel stood in for Smithy, whilst the nominal victor of the day drew the pairings
    using the customary torn-up beer mat in ash-tray sorting hat process. Sprinks duly drew himself and
    Shanks, thus gifting victory to Smithy and Snorks. Normal service has been resumed.
