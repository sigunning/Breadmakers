    Notwithstanding a lame excuse from Diesel concerning a non-drink related fall, 
    a good turnout was enjoyed. Snorks provided welcoming bacon sandwiches on 
    crusty white with beverage in the car park, closely followed by an excellent 
    offering from Shanks - a turkey medley on cranberry white. In mid-round 
    there was pastrami on wholemeal from Bryan, roast turkey dinner on soft 
    white from Smithy and an Amaretto and cinnamon surprise roll from Sprinks.
