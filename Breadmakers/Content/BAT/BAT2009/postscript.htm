            Many thanks for an excellent weekend and all the organisation that went in to
            ensure that the standard of the annual challenge was maintained in such an effortless
            manner. Thanks Kebab for the splendid accommodation and to ensure that no accidents
            happened with the non slip floor in the kitchen, a great innovation!. Please pass
            on our appreciations to your contacts for getting us on at Hillside, certainly my
            favourite course and clubhouse with personal air show. Some things are best left
            up North of which Doris is one.

    It might be worth as a gesture of appreciation to 
    Sean for his contribution, to arrange and introduction to Doris. I hope that Mrs Shanks 
    was thrilled to see the wonderful trophy back that she can again polish and nurture 
    next year. Well played to Shanks, a credible performance off (almost) scratch.

        The night-life in Preston was par excellence. A bus into town, posh Indian Restaurants and sophisticated
        bars with elegant clientelle. I also appreciated the way Kebab played Royal Birkdale down the last.
        Four hours in the bar before Fleetwood was an interesting tactic. Kirkby Lonsdale in the Sun was
        perfection. And so was the Northen food - Barm cake anyone?

    Tim, I hope that you invest in some extra study on the probabilities of scores and 
    discarding of cards. I trust that the Club secretary will be recording the scores, 
    and publishing the results so the handicap committee will not have to deliberate 
    too long for when we all meet again. For the two drivers, Shanks and Diesel, many 
    thanks for a sterling job, much appreciated. I can but echo the sentiments, most 
    ably conjured up by my fellow bothers. A truly excellent tour in the mould of 
    previous encounters. While I am proud to have defended my title and to be the 
    ‘Champion Golfer of 2009’, I’ve been ruminating on the likelihood of our single 
    figure handicaps playing into my grips somewhat. I will be hiring a particle 
    accelerator to run the stats and come with a handicapping proposal for 2010. 
    I trust the expenses policy will accommodate this? The Kebab House proved to be 
    fantastic accommodation. A hearty thanks to the not-so-big one. Every Doris 
    has her day (and some have clearly had a few too many!).
