	I thought you should and would like to know that the BMGS 'Green' or should
	it be Black and White Dog tooth Jacket has survived the cleaning process
	in tact. A magnificant example of a certain age it is to. (Max Miller eat
	your heart out) I could not be more proud to be the first recipient of
	this outstanding award. Thanks to you all for providing such an excellent tour.

	Many congratulations to Bryan on a magnificent victory. It is very fitting
	that you were the one to take home your beloved Jacket, you Breadmakers
	International Tour CHampion. I do hope Sylvia appreciates the effort that
	went in choosing it, trying to suppress the fits of giggles, unsuccessfully,
	in the shop and all the way back to the hotel. Both Diesel and I were
	snapping at your heels on the final day, but you were resolute and could
	even show off with a trick shot on the 15th. Try not to let Smithy remove
	any more engravings from the BATWAIII, there's a good fellow. And his 23
	on the back nine is worthy of note for the Handicap Committee. God's Own
	Country did us proud with the courses and the weather. Many thanks to
	Snorks for do the organisational donkey work - who better? Perhaps the
	odd round before next year might be an idea, now you have the single point
	discard trophy. And as for Shanks ending up a double figure handicap golfer
	with anger management issues - who'd have thought? Thanks to all for another
	excellent tour.
