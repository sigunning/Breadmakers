 	<h2>The Emperor Fights Back</h2>
	<p class="text-info">Bryan Takes the Bin after a Playoff with Diesel</p>

<p >Thank you Sprinks for providing such privileged surroundings and 
	well done to Diesel and our eventual champion golfer, The Emperor of Cambridge 
	(proof positive that the ice caps are melting), for playing some great stuff 
	and taking us to the wire. Mentions also for the Kebab for keeping his sense of 
	humour in trying circumstances (playing with me on all three days) and of 
	course to Snorks for sleeping with me. A superb week-end culminating with 
	a major exercise of course re-design and a nerve wracking finale. My 
	thanks to you all for another fond tour memory and of course thanks to 
	Sprinks and Shanks for their organisational talents. Congratulations 
	to 'Aptenodytes forsteri ' for securing the coveted trophy and of 
	course I bow (several times) to his Ming type mastery of the weapons 
	of course destruction. thanks for allowing us to share some of the 
	traditional riches of a Cambridge Scholar and the most wonderful 
	accommodation. I bow to the gentleman on my left and right in 
	acknowledging my thanks and gratitude.</p>
