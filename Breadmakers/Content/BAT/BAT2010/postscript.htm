<p>May I thank you for a really wonderful organised weekend. 
	Not only did you grace us with such comfortable accommodation, 
	warmth and fine dinning but your hospitality was very much appreciated. 
	Your forward planning to ensure the weather was perfect and the courses in 
	such good condition and up to the high standard we have got accustomed to 
	expect, again you have to be commended for a great job. The "Norfolk and Good" 
	clubhouse is a superb addition to our collection of worldwide venues, and the 
	courses were as ever of the highest standard. I was disappointed that we seem 
	not to have to rush about, nowhere near a 40 minute journey between courses, 
	nd that a table had already been booked. Perhaps these long standing traditions 
	can be added back on future events. I feel a special thanks should go to Snorks, 
	who showed me what real damage can be done with a slice. I shall double my efforts 
	to try and reach your house busting standards.</p>
