 	<h2>The Emperor Gives Back</h2>
	<p class="text-info">Sprinks receives the Bin from a reluctant Bryan</p>

	<p>Heythrop was spectacular, Tadmarton a little gem and Aspley a classic. 
	What's more, it was the best tour for ale, which should be noted in the 
	archives, especially the under-the-counter yellow stuff in the Falklands. 
	Well done Brother Shanks. There was sadness and happiness as we said goodbye 
	to a much loved member, Brother Kebab, but welcomed Brother Smithy to the 
	fold. Never now will the name of Kebab grace the hallowed artefact, but we 
	look forward Smithy adding his name there in the not too distant future. 
	Most importantly, I would like to thank the munificent Snorks and his 
	delightful family for offering to share their lovely home for the weekend; 
	it was a real treat and we look forward to seeing more of the great man 
	now that he is back in Blighty. I would like to thank Smithy and Diesel 
	for my 12 handicap. I would like to actually see some of the holes that 
	we played on Saturday morning. I would like to apologise to Diesel for 
	trying to kill him with consecutive shots on the 12th. I would like 
	Shanks to apologise for consecutive eponymous shots on the 16th.

	As befits our Champion golfer and Scribe (and newly appointed archivist) 
	I commend his account as a true and accurate account of matters recently 
	passed. Having witnessed his golf at first hand I can only reaffirm 
	how deserved a victory this was (11 shots for the record). I hereby 
	apologise for signing up for the nominative determinism society and 
	promise to work to resign the life membership I’ve just received in 
	the post. I can also confirm a particularly active post-tour handicap 
	committee and the appointment of Lance Armstrong to head an enquiry 
	into exactly how a 12 handicap was proffered. Expect no stone to be 
	left unturned and swingeing penalties to be handed out to those found 
	guilty of malpractice. The Family Snorks emerge from the tour 
	unblemished with their reputations for marvellous hospitality 
	enhanced. We can only wonder at their charity and the arguments 
	the must have inevitably ensued! Bro Smithy’s time will come and 
	we can only hope his change of name will lead to more activity on 
	the golf course. Bro Diesel deserves commendation for the wearing 
	of shorts against all reason and Bro Emperor Bryan need not worry 
	about bringing the trophy next year but should reflect on how 
	tremendous he was in winning it last year.</p>
