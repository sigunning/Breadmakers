 	<h2>Shanks' Verdict</h2>
    <p class="text-info">
        An extremely enjoyable tour. Congratulations all! Of particular note: Hulencourt hospitality.
        Gay bar darts. Diesel as Father Jack Hackett...."RUM!!!!"
    </p>
<p>
        Here's a character summary for Father Jack...I'm sure you'll recognise the traits!
        "If anything's toxic and in liquid form, he'll drink it. Jack is a bit of an alcoholic, 
        although it's very subtly presented in the program, almost hidden. He's also very dangerous 
        in a violent way if disturbed by anyone at any time." The stupendous snoring of his kebabliness.
        Sprinks playing 65% of all shots with his £20 new club...getting value! 
        The addition of the rolling-nearest-the-pins - nice one Dies! The fantastic accommodation - a massive
        thank you Snorks. Bryan changing from dry to wet hats without disturbing a single follicle. 
        The only thing I didn't enjoy - but did appreciate - was Snorks' 300m driving and 
        dead-eye-putting 'down the stretch' on day 3. Some actions that I vaguely 
        recall:
